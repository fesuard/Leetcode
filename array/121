You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        current_p = prices[0]
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] < current_p:
                current_p = prices[i]
            profit = max(profit, prices[i] - current_p)
        return profit
