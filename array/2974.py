# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-game/description/
# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length and there is also an empty array arr. Alice and Bob
# decided to play a game where in every round Alice and Bob will do one move. The rules of the game are as follows:
# Every round, first Alice will remove the minimum element from nums, and then Bob does the same.
# Now, first Bob will append the removed element in the array arr, and then Alice does the same.
# The game continues until nums becomes empty. Return the resulting array arr.
