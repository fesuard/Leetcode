# https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people/description/
# You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers.
# Both arrays are of length n. For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.
# Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

    def sortPeople(self, names: List[str], heights: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        final_list = []
        tuple_list = zip(names, heights)
        sorted_tuple_list = sorted(tuple_list, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        for elem in sorted_tuple_list:
            final_list.append(elem[0])
        return final_list
