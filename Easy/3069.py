# https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-elements-into-two-arrays-i/description/
# You are given a 1-indexed array of distinct integers nums of length n.You need to distribute all the elements
# of nums between two arrays arr1 and arr2 using n operations. In the first operation, append nums[1] to arr1.
# In the second operation, append nums[2] to arr2. Afterwards, in the ith operation: If the last element of arr1
# is greater than the last element of arr2, append nums[i] to arr1. Otherwise, append nums[i] to arr2. The array
# result is formed by concatenating the arrays arr1 and arr2. For example, if arr1 == [1,2,3] and arr2 == [4,5,6],
# then result = [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Return the array result.

class Solution:
    def resultArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        arr1 = [nums[0]]
        arr2 = [nums[1]]
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            if arr1[-1] > arr2[-1]:
                arr1.append(nums[i])
            else:
                arr2.append(nums[i])
        return arr1 + arr2
