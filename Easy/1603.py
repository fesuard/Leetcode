# https://leetcode.com/problems/design-parking-system/description
# Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: 
# big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size. Implement the ParkingSystem
# class: ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) Initializes object of the ParkingSystem 
# class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
# bool addCar(int carType) Checks whether there is a parking space of carType for the car that
# wants to get into the parking lot. carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which
# are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. A car can only park in a parking space of its 
# carType. If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and
# return true.
