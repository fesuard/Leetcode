# https://leetcode.com/problems/find-missing-and-repeated-values/description/
# You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * n with values in the range [1, n2].
# Each integer appears exactly once except a which appears twice and b which is missing.
# The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers a and b.
# Return a 0-indexed integer array ans of size 2 where ans[0] equals to a and ans[1] equals to b.
